Stop the annoying spam sign ups on your BuddyPress site with this simple plugin

== Description ==

This BuddyPress plugin adds an input field during the registration sign up process that is hidden for normal users and
will be filled out by bots. If the field contains data then the registration will fail. If it's empty then the
registration will continue.

This plugin has no options because options are overrated!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bp-registration-honeypot` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! The plugin is installed and is working on your site :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many spam bots has this plugin stopped? =
