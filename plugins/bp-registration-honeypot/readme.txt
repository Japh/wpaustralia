Stop the annoying spam signups on your BuddyPress site with this simple plugin

== Description ==

This BuddyPress plugin adds an input field on the registration that is hidden for normal users and will be filled out by
bots. If the field contains data then the registration will fail. If it's empty then the registration will continue.
This plugin has no options because options are overrated!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bp-registration-honeypot` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! The plugin is working on your site :)
